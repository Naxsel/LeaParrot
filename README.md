# LeaParrot
Project for Pervasive Computing - M7012E, Lule√• University of Technology

## Objectives
* Pilot a Parrot AR Drone using the Leap Motion Controller
* Display the visuals from the camera into an VR device
* Use motion planning systems to control the Drone ([LeapMotion](https://www.leapmotion.com/))

## Doc

* Node.js: How to [install](https://nodejs.org/es/)

* To be able to work with Leap Motion it is need the [Motion Leap SDK](https://www.leapmotion.com/setup)

* [Cylon: JavaScript Robotics](https://cylonjs.com/), framework for JavaScript, which has an extensible system for connecting to hardware devices such ARDrone or LeapMotion
